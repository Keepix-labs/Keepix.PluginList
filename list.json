Compatible with a range of platforms including Linux (ARM64, X64), Windows (X64, ARM64), and OSX (X64, ARM64), it simplifies complex configurations and optimizations. Features include integration with Ethereum wallets, MEV enable/disable option, and mainnet operation. Requires network port 30303 (inbound and outbound) for operation which is auto-managed on your network (using UPnP). An intuitive installation form ensures proper configuration and ease of use, making it a valuable tool for efficient Ethereum RocketPool smart node management.",
